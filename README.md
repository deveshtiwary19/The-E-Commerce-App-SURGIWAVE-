Usage Instructions:
I have not uploaded  the jSon File for FireBase Databse,you require a databse of your own.
You have to create a database on Firebase Console and link it to your app in android studio.


The app has a admin pannel too.
So,creating a admin account from the app is not possible because there will only be one admin acess to the app.
So,under the Realtime Databse,you have to create a nod with name "Admin".
Then you have to create all the fields under that as shown in Screenshots>>Admin.JPG.
Note that all the nodes spell same as in the screenshot.
The data inserted in all three fields must be in double quotes,make sure to double check before leaving the Firebase Console.

Now that you have hardcoded a Admin Account in FireBase,you are good to go.
Users can create their account normally from the app
